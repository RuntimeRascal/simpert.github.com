I'm Tommy Simper. I am a software engineer, computer enthusiast, motocrosser, techie, husband to my wonderfull wife Nikki and a proud father of four awesome unique and super fun boys.

I live in a small community in Utah and work as a senior software engineer for [GMetrix](http://www.gmetrix.com). I often research and implement new (new to us) technologies and build software architecures up and down the stack. I am hardcore about software; this is what I am told anyway. I love to program most anything perhaps even writing unit tests. Is that wierd or what. I enjoy the entire software creation process from mockups through documentation.

I have received **soooo** much information and help from our great industry all over the Internet thorugh blogs, ebooks, and open source projects. I would love to pay it forward. I spend alot of my time explaining software concepts and technologies to others and it dawned on me that I should create my own blog. So here it is. 

I hope you enjoy.
